# Clustering-Model
This project applies K-Means clustering to segment images based on pixel color similarity. It includes a simple Tkinter GUI for selecting images and specifying cluster count, then visualizes and saves the clustered output. Ideal for experimentation with unsupervised learning and image segmentation.
